&emsp; &emsp; Hello world, I'm a product-minded technology leader with 25+ years building, shipping, and scaling software products across
fintech, digital publishing, civic tech and infrastructure. I have proven ability to lead small, autonomous teams from
idea through launch, crafting roadmaps, running product discovery, and empowering engineers and
designers to make great product decisions. 

Currently building *ACTE123*, a civic-tech platform from the
ground up using Next.js, Supabase, and AI-augmented workflows. Fully remote with a bias toward action, written communication, and a builder's mindset. Actively leveraging AI tools tools (Claude Code,
Moonchild, DeepInfra, Hugginface, phew) to prototype, research, and ship faster.

I love driving classic Porsche cars while I'm sleeping, riding motorcycles and listening to Mexican Rock music while I'm awake. Thin mints, <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreig/andreig.github.io/master/images/hellokitty.png" width="25"> and *caramel sundae* with fries.
